import requests

"""
Solves in only 41 HTTP requests, with 0 assumptions about flag format etc.
I achieve this by stuffing multiple trial plaintexts into each HTTP request,
and exiting early as soon as a matching block is found.
This code is over-optimised, sacrificing readability and thus educational value.
$ time python3 solve.py
...
solved in 41 HTTP requests!
real	0m0.587s
user	0m0.203s
sys	0m0.022s
FUTURE OPTIMISATIONS:
This script solves the plaintext left-to-right. It is also possible to solve
right-to-left. We could do both in parallel and "meet in the middle", to ~halve
the execution time.
